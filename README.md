<h3>Ballzy</h3>
Ballzy is a pong-like game for the NES. It's written in 6502-assembler.

<h4>Installing & Running</h4>
Install required packages and perform symlink synchronization:
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/skrotnisse/ballzy
cd ballzy
make</code></pre>

Running make will both build and run the game at the moment. A prerequisite is to have the 'fceux' NES-emulator installed.

<h4>TODOs</h4>
The code is in heavy need of refactoring. There's lots of duplicate code and stuff that should be sorted out.
